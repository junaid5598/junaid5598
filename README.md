### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I've been enjoying Web3 development since I built my first Solidity project. The user security and transaction transparrency makes me want to leave Web2 ecosystem behind for good. 
I'm currently on the look out for a role in backend Web3 development, ideally writing Solidity with JavaScript. I'd especially love to work at a startup on a tight knit team where I can make an impact quickly. If you're hiring, let's chat!
